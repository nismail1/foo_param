# Foo Parameterization Project

## Introduction

The Foo Parameterization Project is an open-source community project designed to provide an implementation of the fictitious Foo et al. parameterization. This parameterization, which takes the radius of a sphere and returns its volume, is designed to be complex enough to warrant its own software package. The project aims to continuously introduce new science features over the course of many years with contributions from a wide range of developers.

## Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you will need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- A text editor or IDE of your choice

## Project Structure

The project directory structure is as follows:

```
foo_parameterization/
├── core/
│   ├── CalculatorFactory.java
│   ├── FooTransformation.java
│   ├── FooVolumeCalculator.java
│   ├── Transformation.java
│   └── VolumeCalculator.java
├── utils/
│   └── Validators.java
├── tests/
│   └── TestVolume.java
├── examples/
│   └── ExampleUsage.java
├── Main.java
├── .gitignore
├── foo-parameterization.jar
└── README.md
```

### Directories and Files

- **core/**: Contains the core logic for the parameterization.
  - `CalculatorFactory.java`: Factory class to create volume calculator instances.
  - `FooTransformation.java`: Class implementing the Foo-specific transformation logic.
  - `FooVolumeCalculator.java`: Class implementing the Foo-specific volume calculation.
  - `Transformation.java`: Interface for transformation classes.
  - `VolumeCalculator.java`: Interface for volume calculation classes.
- **utils/**: Utility classes.
  - `Validators.java`: Class for validating inputs.
- **tests/**: Unit tests for the project.
  - `TestVolume.java`: Test class for volume calculations.
- **examples/**: Example usage of the project.
  - `ExampleUsage.java`: Example class demonstrating how to use the library.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **foo-parameterization.jar**: The compiled JAR file for the project.
- **README.md**: This documentation file.

## Compilation

To compile the project, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to compile the Java source files:

```
javac -d bin -cp "lib/*" $(find src -name '*.java' -not -path "src/foo_parameterization/tests/*")
 ```
 ```
jar cfm foo-parameterization.jar META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -C bin .
   ```

   This command compiles all Java source files in the `src` directory and places the compiled `.class` files in the `bin` directory.

## Running the Project

### Running the JAR File

1. Ensure that the project has been compiled successfully.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to execute the JAR file:

   ```
   java -jar foo-parameterization.jar <radius>
   ```

## Running Tests

To run the tests, you need to have JUnit set up in your project. 

## Examples

To see an example of how to use the Foo Parameterization library, refer to the `examples/ExampleUsage.java` file. This example demonstrates how to create a volume calculator and perform volume calculations using the Foo parameterization.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while building or running the project, consider the following steps:

- Ensure that you have the correct version of the JDK installed.
- Verify that all necessary dependencies are included in your classpath.
- Check the project directory structure to ensure all files are in their correct locations.
- Review the error messages for specific details about what might be causing the issue.
